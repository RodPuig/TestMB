# TestMB

First, sorry for my English level

+ The time it took you to perform the exercise
-the first level took me 2 hours aprox. Second level 4h 20m aprox because it includes new things like direction Changes. 

+ The parts that were difficult for you and why
-Camera rotations. Fun Race 3D has many camera movements and at first time chose the worst way to manage the problem. first i tried with Transform.RotateAround and then i used gameObjects (playerÂ´s children) to set camera positions.

+ The parts you think you could do better and how
-All, the variety of objects, more direction changes, effects, animations, camera shakes and a long etc

+ What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
-i would allow the player to move on the X axis as in many endless Runner.

+ What did you think
-It was a fun test, before reading the test i was nervous because i thought i would not have time to finish it but i have had time to finish it and play a little with it.

+ Any comment you may have
-I would have liked to prototype a stickman hook.
